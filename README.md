# TDD with Django

This repo contains code + other configuration to develop my ability
to write unit tests for Django.

The initial commit to the repo is based on code developed from 
following the 
[Test Driven Django Development](https://test-driven-django-development.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
tutorial.

At the time of the [initial commit](https://github.com/thomasbridge74/djangotdd/releases/tag/v1.0), all tests were passing on my
local machine.
